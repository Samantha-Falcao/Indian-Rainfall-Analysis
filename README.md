Analysis of rainfall patterns in Indian and its various subdivisions with the help of historic data of 25 years

## About
The 2019 Indian floods were a series of floods that affected over thirteen states in late July and early August 2019, due to incessant rains. At least 200 people died and about a million people were displaced. Karnataka and Maharashtra were the most severely affected states.

It was the heaviest monsoon in the last 25 years. More than 1600 people died between June and October 2019.

India being an agriculturally driven economy, it will be interesting to study the rainfall in India in the past decade to give us an idea of the changes in the pattern if there are any.
